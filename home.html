<h3>
    In 1965 a landmark ruling came down from the Supreme Court of the United States that had far reaching implications on a citizen's right to privacy, this case is known as Griswold v. Connecticut. 
</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
    In New Haven, Connecticut, in 1961 Estelle Griswold, the Executive Director of Planned Parenthood League, and C. Lee Buxton, a gynecologist at the Yale School of Medicine, were running a Planned Parenthood Clinic when they were arrested and charged with advising married couples on ways to prevent conception as well as “prescribing a contraceptive device or material for the wife’s use.” Griswold and Buxton were prosecuted on the grounds that they violated an 1879 law that strictly prohibited “any person who uses any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception.” This law extended to not only the principal offender but also to “any person who assists, abets, counsels, causes, hires or commands another to commit any offense,” and held a penalty of a fine “not less than forty dollars or imprisoned not less than sixty days.” At the time of their conviction Griswold and Buxton were both fined One Hundred dollars each.
<h2>The Appellant's Legal Argument</h2>
    On March 29-30, 1965, Griswold et al. argued to the Supreme Court that their conviction of 1879 “Connecticut law violated their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.”

<h2>The Court's Decision</h2> 
    On June 7, 1965 the Supreme Court handed down its decision in which they not only sided with the appellants but they also found that the 1879 law violated a married couple’s “right to marital privacy” and struck down the statute. The Court’s argument came down to a 7-2 decision in favor for Griswold et al. and concluded that although the “Constitution does not explicitly protect a general right to privacy, the various guarantees within the Bill of Rights create a penumbras, or zones, that establish a right to privacy.” The Court argued that “together, the First, Third, Fourth, and Ninth Amendments create the right to privacy in marital relations.” In addition, the Fifth Amendment is referenced as the law violated the citizen’s right to avoid self-incrimination.

    <h2>Consequences of the Ruling</h2>
        At the time of the Supreme Court’s ruling women did not have control over their family planning and this contributed to inequality and increase in the problems associated with health conditions effected by pregnancy.  According to the CDC, women’s ability to access birth control has an impact on not only women’s social and economic roles but also on their health as a whole. The 1965 ruling meant women were given the choice to plan their pregnancies. The ability to plan for pregnancy led to healthier pregnancies for both mother and child, as well as contributed towards a decline of maternal mortality. It also meant that women had the ability to focus on further education and professional careers without the disruption of an unplanned pregnancy. It is because of this ability to plan that women have been able to close both the wage and professional gaps between men and women. In addition to the direct impact the ruling has had on women and families, the ruling has also become a reference in many Supreme Court arguments for rulings following 1965.
