        <h2>Software Life Cycle: Development Phase:</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Requirements analysis:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consists of compiling and analyzing the needs of the software user; negotiating with the project's stakeholders over trade-offs between wants, needs, costs, and feasibility; and finally, developing a set of requirements that identify the features and services that the finished software system must have. The goal of which is to specify what services the proposed system will provide, to identify any conditions (time constraints, security, and so on) on those services, and to define how the outside world will interact with the system.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Design:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Involves creating a plan for the construction of the proposed system. The result of the design phase is a detailed description of the software system's structure that can be converted into programs.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Implementation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Involves the actual writing of programs, creation of data files, and development of databases. </li> 
                </ul>
            <h3>Testing:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Essentially equated with the process of debugging programs and confirming that the final software product was compatible with the software requirements specification.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Modular Implementation:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Is based on the goal during the initial software desgin; either as imperative paradigms, in which modules appear as functions, or in object-oriented paradigms, which uses objects as the basic modular constituents.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Unifed Modeling Language (UML):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Modern collection of tools that have been developed with the object-oriented paradigm in mind.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Use Case:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> The interactions between the system and its user.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Use Case Diagram:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Depicts the proposed system as a large rectangle in which interactions between the system and its users are represented as ovals and users of the systems are represented as stick figures.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Relationships:</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>One-to-One:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Indicates the association multiplicities occurs as only one to one.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>One-to-Many:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Indicates the association multiplicities occurs as one to many.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Many-to-Many:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Indicates the association multiplicities occurs as many to many.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Design Pattern:</h2>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <h3>Glass Box Testing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The software tester is aware of the interior structure of the software and uses this knowledge when designing the test.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Black Box Testing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Refers to tests that do not rely on knowledge of the software's interior composition.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Beta Testing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Falls within the black-box category; where a preliminary version of the software is given to a segment of the intended audience with the goal of learning how the software performs in real-life situations before the final version of the product is solidified and released to the market.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Alpha Testing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Similar testing to beta testing but is performed at the developer's site.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>System Documentation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The purpose is to describe the software's internal composition so that the software can be maintained late in its life cycle.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Technical Documentation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The purpose is to describe how a software system should be installed and serviced.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Intellectual Property Law:</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Software License:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Where the rights of the developer are formally expressed in legal terms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Software Disclaimer:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Statements in the software licenses that state the limitations of a developer's liability.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Best defense against software liability claims:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To apply sound software engineering principles during the software's development, to use a level of care compatible with the software's application, and to produce and maintain records that validate these endeavors.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
